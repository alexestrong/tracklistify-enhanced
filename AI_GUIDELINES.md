# AI Guidelines for Tracklistify

This document outlines the AI-related guidelines and best practices for the Tracklistify project, focusing on audio recognition, track identification, and machine learning aspects.

## Audio Recognition System

### ACRCloud Integration
- Use ACRCloud's audio fingerprinting technology for accurate track identification
- Maintain proper error handling for API responses
- Implement rate limiting to stay within API quotas
- Cache results when possible to minimize API calls

### Confidence Scoring
- Track matches with confidence scores below 70% should be flagged for review
- Multiple matches within a 5-second window should be consolidated
- Consider track popularity and release date in confidence calculations

## Track Identification Optimization

### Audio Processing
- Process audio in 10-second segments for optimal recognition
- Maintain a 5-second overlap between segments to catch transitions
- Apply audio normalization before recognition when possible
- Handle various audio formats and quality levels gracefully

### False Positive Mitigation
- Implement duplicate detection with fuzzy matching
- Compare track lengths with original mix duration
- Cross-reference artist names with mix metadata when available
- Flag suspicious patterns (e.g., same track detected multiple times)

## Machine Learning Considerations

### Model Training
- Collect and maintain a dataset of failed recognitions
- Document edge cases and common failure modes
- Consider implementing local fingerprinting for popular tracks

### Feature Extraction
- Focus on key audio features:
  - Beat patterns
  - Frequency spectrum
  - Energy distribution
  - Temporal characteristics

### Performance Metrics
- Track recognition accuracy rate
- False positive/negative rates
- Processing time per track
- API usage efficiency

## Future AI Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. Local track fingerprinting for offline recognition
2. DJ transition detection
3. Genre classification
4. BPM detection and matching
5. Custom audio fingerprinting model

### Data Collection
- Maintain user privacy when collecting recognition data
- Document all data processing steps
- Follow data retention policies
- Implement data anonymization where necessary

## Best Practices

### Quality Assurance
- Regular validation of recognition accuracy
- Monitoring of API performance
- Testing with various audio qualities and formats
- Documentation of recognition patterns and issues

### Error Handling
- Implement graceful degradation
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log recognition failures for analysis
- Maintain fallback recognition methods

## Version Control
- Tag AI-related changes in commits
- Document model versions and changes
- Track recognition accuracy across versions
- Maintain backwards compatibility

## Contribution Guidelines
1. Document all AI-related changes
2. Test recognition accuracy before commits
3. Update performance metrics
4. Follow the established error handling patterns
5. Maintain API usage efficiency
