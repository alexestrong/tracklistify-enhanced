Tracklistify is an automatic tracklist generator for DJ mixes and audio streams. This guide provides a systematic approach to refactoring the codebase, focusing on improving code quality, maintainability, and architectural design without altering external behavior.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Poetry 1.7+
- Git
- FFmpeg (required for audio processing)
- Graphviz (for UML diagrams)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/betmoar/tracklistify.git
cd tracklistify

# Install Poetry if you haven't already
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install dependencies using Poetry
