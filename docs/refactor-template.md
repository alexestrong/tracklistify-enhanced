# Refactor Plan: Adopting __init__.py Approach

## Objective

Refactor the Python project to:
1. Adopt a modular structure with grouped directories and `__init__.py` for organized imports.
2. Remove unwanted, unused, or duplicate code.
3. Simplify the overall project structure while maintaining functionality.
4. Ensure no regressions occur during or after the refactoring process.

## Steps to Refactor the Project

### Step 1: Analyze the Existing Structure

1. List all the files, directories, and modules in the project.
2. Identify:
   - Duplicated functionality across files.
   - Unused or outdated modules and code.
   - Interdependent modules that may cause circular imports.

### Step 2: Plan the New Structure

1. Group related modules into directories representing logical components (e.g., `core/`, `features/`, `utils/`).
2. Create an `__init__.py` file for each directory to serve as the package interface.
3. Define the public API for each package in its `__init__.py` file using `__all__`.

#### Example Plan:

```
project/
├── core/
│   ├── __init__.py  # Core functionality methods
├── utils/
├── config/
├── feature-a/
│   ├── __init__.py  # Feature aggregation
│   ├── module1.py
│   ├── module2.py
├── feature_b/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── module3.py
│   ├── module4.py
```

### Step 3: Refactor Each Component

1. Remove Unused Code:
   - Use tools like `vulture` to detect unused functions, classes, or imports.
   - Validate findings manually before deletion to avoid removing critical code.
2. Eliminate Duplicated Code:
   - Identify similar or identical code blocks.
   - Extract common functionality into reusable functions or classes in a shared module (e.g., `core/utils.py`).
3. Simplify Imports:
   - Move import logic to `__init__.py` files in each directory.
   - Refactor imports across the project to use package-level imports instead of direct module imports.

   **Before:**
   ```python
   from feature_a.module1 import func1
   from feature_a.module2 import ClassA
   ```
   **After:**
   ```python
   from feature_a import func1, ClassA
   ```

4. Encapsulate and Expose Only Necessary Functions:
   - Use `__all__` in `__init__.py` to define the package’s public interface and hide internal details.

   **Example (`feature_a/__init__.py`):**
   ```python
   from .module1 import func1
   from .module2 import ClassA

   __all__ = ["func1", "ClassA"]
   ```

### Step 4: Test the Refactored Code

1. Ensure Coverage:
   - Write or update unit tests for all functionality to cover edge cases.
   - Use tools like `pytest` and `coverage.py` to track test coverage.
2. Automate Regression Testing:
   - Compare outputs from the original and refactored versions for consistency.
   - Use snapshot testing or generate test data to validate no functionality has regressed.
3. Run the Project:
   - Test the project manually to confirm it behaves as expected.

### Step 5: Optimize Project Organization

1. Standardize Naming Conventions:
   - Use clear and consistent names for modules, directories, and functions (e.g., `snake_case` for functions, `PascalCase` for classes).
2. Document the New Structure:
   - Add a `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` file explaining the directory structure and how to use the refactored code.

#### Example Documentation:

**Directory Structure:**
- `core/`: Shared utilities and common validation logic.
- `features/`: Independent features grouped into sub-packages.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.

**Usage:**
```python
from core import validate_data
from features.feature_a import func1
```

## Prompt Template for Refactoring

I want to refactor a Python project to adopt a modular directory structure with grouped code directories and `__init__.py` files for organized imports. The refactor should:
1. Simplify the overall structure by grouping related functionality into directories.
2. Centralize imports in `__init__.py` files to create clean and maintainable package interfaces.
3. Remove duplicate or unused code to reduce bloat.
4. Ensure the refactor does not introduce regressions or break existing functionality by validating with automated tests.

Please provide a step-by-step `refactor-plan.md`, including best practices for organizing the new structure, writing `__init__.py` files, and testing for regressions.
