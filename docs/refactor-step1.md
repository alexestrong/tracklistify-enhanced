# Refactoring Plan

## Introduction

This refactoring plan aims to enhance the maintainability, performance, and reliability of the **Tracklistify** project. By analyzing the current codebase, we've identified areas for improvement, duplication, and simplification. This plan provides a step-by-step guide to refactor the codebase, incorporating best practices and utilizing tools to streamline the process.

## Analysis of Codebase

### Duplicate and Overlapping Code

1. **Logging**
    - **Issue:** Logging functionalities are implemented in multiple modules (`track.py`, `base.py`, and `utils/logger.py`).
    - **Action:** Centralize logging by consolidating all logging configurations and utilities into a single module within `utils/logger.py`.

2. **Validation**
    - **Issue:** Validation functions are spread across `utils/validation.py` and `config/validation.py`, causing redundancy.
    - **Action:** Merge validation logic into a single module (`utils/validation.py`) to avoid duplication and streamline validation processes.

3. **Configuration Documentation Generation**
    - **Issue:** Code for generating configuration documentation is present in both `generate_config_docs.py` and within tests (`test_config.py`).
    - **Action:** Refactor documentation generation into a dedicated module or class and import it where needed to prevent code duplication.

4. **Error Handling**
    - **Issue:** Inconsistent error handling and custom exception usage across modules.
    - **Action:** Standardize error handling by defining custom exceptions in the `exceptions` module and ensuring consistent usage throughout the codebase.

### Simplification Opportunities

1. **Track Processing**
    - **Issue:** Complex logic within `TrackMatcher` can be streamlined.
    - **Action:** Extract common functionalities into helper methods and reduce complexity by applying the Single Responsibility Principle.

2. **Audio Splitting**
    - **Issue:** The `split_audio` method in `AsyncApp` contains nested functions and complex error handling.
    - **Action:** Refactor `split_audio` by extracting the nested `create_segment` function into a separate method or utility function, simplifying the flow and making it more testable.

3. **Configuration Management**
    - **Issue:** Configuration loading and validation are scattered.
    - **Action:** Centralize configuration loading, parsing, and validation within the `config` module, and implement environment variable support for better flexibility.

4. **Utilities Consolidation**
    - **Issue:** Helper functions and utilities are dispersed.
    - **Action:** Group all utility functions into the `utils` package, and use `__init__.py` to manage imports effectively.

## Updated Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: **Project Structuring and Cleanup**

1. **Consolidate Modules**
    - Merge duplicate logging and validation modules.
    - Ensure `utils` contains all shared utilities.
    - Remove or refactor unnecessary files (e.g., multiple `factory.py` files).

2. **Standardize Naming Conventions**
    - Use `snake_case` for functions and methods.
    - Use `PascalCase` for class names.
    - Ensure consistency across the codebase.

3. **Simplify Imports with `__init__.py`**
    - Clean up and organize imports in `__init__.py` files for better module accessibility.
    - Define `__all__` to specify public interfaces.

4. **Remove Dead Code**
    - Use tools like `vulture` to detect unused code.
    - Remove obsolete functions, classes, and modules.

### Phase 2: **Core Refactoring**

1. **Refactor Track Processing Engine**
    - Improve asynchronous handling in `TrackProcessor`.
    - Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.
    - Enhance error handling using standardized exceptions.

2. **Enhance Provider Interfaces**
    - Define a clear protocol or abstract base class for providers.
    - Ensure all providers adhere to the same interface.
    - Implement fallback mechanisms for provider failures.

3. **Optimize Configuration Management**
    - Centralize configuration loading and validation.
    - Implement support for environment variables and `.env` files.
    - Add hot-reloading capabilities for configuration changes.

### Phase 3: **Provider and Downloader Improvements**

1. **Improve Provider Factory**
    - Implement provider chaining and prioritization.
    - Allow dynamic enabling/disabling of providers via configuration.
